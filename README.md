# Deep Learning Udacity

This repository contains work that I did as part of Deep Learning Nano degree program on Udacity. 

## Projects implemented are as follows:

### 1. Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns.

Built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on Bike Sharing Patterns.


### 2. Dog Breed Classifier using CNN.

Built a CNN to identify an estimate of Cannie's Breed. 

### 3. Generating TV Scripts using RNN.

Generates my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs.

### 4. Generating Faces using DCGAN.

Used generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

### 5. Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model using AWS SageMaker.

Construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set.  Amazon's SageMaker service was used to create this model. In addition, deployed model and constructed a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
